The brush looks ancient—its wooden handle worn smooth, its bristles somehow still perfect.\n\nThe moment {{PLAYER2_NAME}} touches it too, the brush begins to glow. Colors swirl around them like a living painting—deep blues, vibrant reds, shimmering golds.\n\nWhen the colors fade, they're standing in a cobblestone street. The air smells of paint and woodsmoke. People in strange old-fashioned clothes hurry past.\n\n'Welcome to Florence,' says a voice. A young man with paint-stained hands grins at them. 'The year is 1504. I am Giuliano, apprentice to the great masters. That brush you hold—it belongs to the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci himself! Come, he will want to meet you.'",
